<h1>About me</h1>
I am a professor of Computer Science, but I also have been known to dabble in penetration testing. 
I love to participate in CTFs, although I rarely get the time to dedicate myself to an entire competition. 
As a professor, I am dedicated to the idea of practical education. 
I believe that, in the area of Computer Science in general, and especially in the field of Cyber Security, 
students must have realistic hands-on experiences.
